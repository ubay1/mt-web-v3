# Tailwind CSS v4: Speed Without Bounds

The latest version of Tailwind brings major changes in the way we design. With a faster new engine, we can iterate designs in seconds.

## Key Features of v4
- **Zero-runtime engine**: Significantly faster build performance.
- **Composable Variants**: Ease of creating custom variants.
- **CSS-first configuration**: More intuitive configuration directly in CSS.

### Custom Utility Tutorial
Example usage of the new utility for the grid system:
```css
@utility custom-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

With this approach, our code remains clean and maintainable.
