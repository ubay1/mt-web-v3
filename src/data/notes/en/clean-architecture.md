# Tidy Code with Clean Architecture

Is your Node.js project a mess? Clean Architecture helps separate business logic from technical details.

## Layers
1. **Domain**: Pure business rules (Entities & Use Cases).
2. **Infrastructure**: Implementation of databases or external APIs.
3. **Interface**: Controllers, Routes, and Presentors.

The advantage is that your code becomes easy to test and does not depend on a specific framework. If you want to switch your database from MongoDB to PostgreSQL, you only need to change the Infrastructure layer.
